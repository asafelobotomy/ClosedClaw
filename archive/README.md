# Archive Directory

This directory contains deprecated or historical content that may still be useful for reference but is no longer actively maintained.

## Contents

- **update_clawdbot.md** - Historical workflow documentation for syncing from upstream (Clawdbot era)
- **.pi/** - Legacy Pi coding agent utilities and prompts (moved from root, not referenced in active code)

## Purpose

Files are moved here instead of being deleted to preserve:
- Historical context and workflows
- Potentially useful reference material
- Recovery options if needed

If you're certain content is no longer needed, it can be safely removed from this directory.
