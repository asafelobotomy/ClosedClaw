title: Deploy on Northflank
---

Deploy ClosedClaw on Northflank with a one-click template and finish setup in your browser.
This is the easiest “no terminal on the server” path: Northflank runs the Gateway for you,
and you configure everything via the `/setup` web wizard.

## How to get started

1. Click [Deploy ClosedClaw](https://northflank.com/stacks/deploy-ClosedClaw) to open the template.
2. Create an [account on Northflank](https://app.northflank.com/signup) if you don’t already have one.
3. Click **Deploy ClosedClaw now**.
4. Set the required environment variable: `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
5. Click **Deploy stack** to build and run the ClosedClaw template.
6. Wait for the deployment to complete, then click **View resources**.
7. Open the ClosedClaw service.
8. Open the public ClosedClaw URL and complete setup at `/setup`.
9. Open the Control UI at `/ClosedClaw`.

## What you get

- Hosted ClosedClaw Gateway + Control UI
- Web setup wizard at `/setup` (no terminal commands)
- Persistent storage via Northflank Volume (`/data`) so config/credentials/workspace survive redeploys

## Setup flow

1. Visit `https://<your-northflank-domain>/setup` and enter your `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
2. Choose a model/auth provider and paste your key.
3. (Optional) Add supported channel credentials (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).
4. Click **Run setup**.
5. Open the Control UI at `https://<your-northflank-domain>/ClosedClaw`

## Getting chat tokens

Refer to the channel-specific docs for obtaining tokens for Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, or Matrix.
